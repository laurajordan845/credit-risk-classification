# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Supervised Learning Challenge for Laura Jordan

## Description
In this exercise, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The challenge included 4 subsections:
* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
* Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Support
I attended class, reviewed our in-class activities and read through my notes for the support needed for this challenge assignment.

## Submission Includes
* Notebook: credit_risk_classification_LJordan.ipynb
* Readme file with the Credit Risk Analysis: [Link to Analysis](https://github.com/laurajordan845/credit-risk-classification/blob/main/analysis.md)
* Resources folder which houses the lending_data.csv file with the dataset
